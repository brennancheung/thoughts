# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal knowledge repository called "thoughts" focused on documenting ideas and concepts, particularly around improving developer-AI communication. It is NOT a traditional software project with code, dependencies, or build processes.

## Key Content

The main content is the Domain-Specific Intermediary Language (DSIL) documentation in `ai/domain_language_intro.md`, which proposes:
- A YAML-like syntax for describing UI components and functionality
- A methodology for iterative refinement between humans and AI
- Examples and templates for better AI comprehension

## Working with This Repository

### Content Organization
- Place new thought documents in appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `ai/` for AI-related concepts)
- Use descriptive markdown filenames that clearly indicate the content

### Document Standards
- Use markdown for all documentation
- Include clear headings and structure
- Provide concrete examples when introducing concepts
- Keep ideas self-contained within individual documents

### When Adding Content
- Maintain the repository's focus on ideas and concepts rather than implementation
- Ensure new documents are well-structured and clearly written
- Add appropriate context and background for complex ideas
- Include practical examples or use cases where relevant

## Note

Since this is a documentation repository, there are no build commands, tests, or linting processes. Focus on clear, well-organized content that effectively communicates ideas.
