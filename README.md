# Thoughts

A digital garden where I cultivate and share my evolving thoughts, ideas, and explorations. This repository serves as an open notebookâ€”a space for intellectual wandering, experimentation, and collaborative refinement of concepts that intrigue me.

Here, you'll find musings on technology, software development practices, human-AI collaboration, and whatever else captures my curiosity. Each document represents a thought in progress, inviting iteration, discussion, and growth.
