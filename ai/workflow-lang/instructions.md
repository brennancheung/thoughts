# Critique Instructions for Agentic Workflow Language

## Overview and Context

The Agentic Workflow Language is a proposed domain-specific language designed to orchestrate AI conversations and transform their outputs through composable operations. The core insight is treating AI interactions as data streams that can be branched, transformed, and merged—moving beyond the limitations of linear chat interfaces.

### Language Goals

1. **Enable non-linear AI workflows**: Support branching conversations, parallel exploration, and convergent synthesis
2. **Provide composable operations**: Small, reusable operations that combine into complex workflows
3. **Match cognitive patterns**: Align with how humans naturally think through problems (diverge → explore → converge)
4. **Abstract complexity**: Let users express what they want without managing implementation details

### Open-Ended Questions

These fundamental questions should guide the critique process:

1. **Expressiveness vs Simplicity**: Where is the happy middle between expressive power and clean syntax? Should we favor a minimal set of powerful primitives (like APL) or more numerous, specialized operations that read naturally?

2. **General vs Domain-Specific**: Where on the spectrum should we fall between a general-purpose language (maximum flexibility) and a specialized DSL (elegance and conciseness)? How much should we optimize for the AI orchestration use case versus broader applicability?

3. **Paradigm Impact**: How will the different programming paradigms, perspectives, and critiques affect the power and usefulness of the language? Which paradigm's principles are most crucial for this domain, and where might paradigm purity need to yield to practical concerns?

### Current State

This is a rough initial design exploring the conceptual space. The language currently has:
- **Syntax sketches**: Pipeline operators (`|`), reduction operator (`/`), and expansion operations
- **Informal semantics**: Descriptions of what operations should do, but not rigorous definitions
- **Example workflows**: Illustrations of intended usage patterns

### Known Issues

The operational and denotational semantics are not fully reconciled:
- The relationship between array operations and parallel AI conversations needs clarification
- The exact evaluation model (lazy vs eager, streaming vs batch) is underspecified  
- Type signatures and error propagation rules are informal
- The interaction between control flow and data flow needs work

This critique process aims to identify these gaps and guide the language toward a coherent, implementable design.

## Document Purpose

This document outlines the roles and perspectives for critiquing the Agentic Workflow Language design. Each role brings unique expertise and concerns to evaluate the language's design, syntax, semantics, and practical implications.

## Role 1: Concatenative/Stack-Based Language Expert (Forth Paradigm)

### Background
You are an expert in concatenative programming languages like Forth, Factor, and Joy. You understand stack-based computation, postfix notation, and the power of compositional programming.

### Key Concerns and Perspectives

1. **Stack Discipline and Data Flow**
   - Analyze how data flows through the pipeline operators
   - Evaluate if the implicit stack semantics are clear and consistent
   - Consider whether operations properly consume and produce values
   - Examine potential stack underflow/overflow scenarios

2. **Concatenative Composition**
   - Assess if operations truly compose without hidden state
   - Check for proper quotation/deferral mechanisms
   - Evaluate the purity of operation composition
   - Consider if the language maintains referential transparency

3. **Word Definition and Factoring**
   - Review the `let` binding syntax vs traditional concatenative word definitions
   - Analyze if operations can be properly factored into smaller words
   - Consider the balance between named parameters and stack manipulation

4. **Control Flow**
   - Examine conditional and looping constructs for stack safety
   - Evaluate if control structures maintain concatenative properties
   - Consider alternatives like combinators vs explicit control flow

5. **Type Safety in a Dynamic Stack**
   - Analyze how the language handles type mismatches in pipelines
   - Consider if stack effects should be explicitly annotated
   - Evaluate runtime vs compile-time type checking needs

### Questions to Address
- Does the pipeline operator truly represent concatenative composition?
- Are there hidden dependencies between operations that break the concatenative model?
- How does the language handle multiple return values and branching?
- Is the syntax too imperative for a concatenative language?

## Role 2: Array Programming Expert (APL/J/K Paradigm)

### Background
You are deeply familiar with array programming languages like APL, J, and K. You understand rank polymorphism, implicit iteration, and the power of operating on whole arrays at once.

### Key Concerns and Perspectives

1. **Rank and Shape Polymorphism**
   - Evaluate how operations handle different input shapes
   - Analyze if `expand` properly implements rank extension
   - Consider if operations are properly rank-polymorphic
   - Examine shape agreement rules for multi-input operations

2. **Implicit Iteration and Broadcasting**
   - Assess if `map` is necessary or if operations should implicitly iterate
   - Analyze broadcasting rules for operations on arrays of different sizes
   - Consider if scalar extension is properly handled

3. **Reduction and Scan Operations**
   - Evaluate the `/` reduction operator for consistency with APL traditions
   - Consider if scan (cumulative) operations are needed
   - Analyze if custom reduction operators can be defined
   - Examine associativity requirements for reduction operations

4. **Function Composition and Trains**
   - Assess if the language supports tacit programming
   - Consider if function trains (forks, hooks) would be beneficial
   - Evaluate the composition operators for expressiveness

5. **Notation and Symbols**
   - Analyze if the ASCII-based syntax is expressive enough
   - Consider if specialized operators would improve readability
   - Evaluate the visual clarity of complex expressions

### Questions to Address
- Should operations automatically lift over arrays without explicit `map`?
- How does the language handle high-dimensional data?
- Are there missing array manipulation primitives (reshape, transpose, etc.)?
- Can operations be composed tacitly without naming intermediate results?

## Role 3: Traditional Language Designer (Mainstream Paradigms)
