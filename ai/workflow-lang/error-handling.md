# Error Handling in Agentic Workflow Language

## Summary of Discoveries

Through our panel discussion, we've identified that error handling in AI workflows is fundamentally different from traditional programming due to the inherent unreliability and non-determinism of AI operations.

### Key Insights

1. **Partial Success is Normal**: Unlike traditional programming where operations typically succeed or fail completely, AI workflows regularly produce partial results (e.g., requesting 10 responses but getting 7 due to content filters).

2. **Multiple Classification Schemes**: Different paradigms offer complementary ways to think about failures:
   - **By failure type**: Resource constraints, partial success, semantic failures, system failures
   - **By recoverability**: Immediate retry, delayed retry, transform retry, partial accept, hard fail
   - **By shape impact**: Shape-preserving, shape-changing, shape-unknown
   - **By semantic category**: Total, partial, constrained, nondeterministic operations

3. **Progressive Sophistication**: The language should support multiple levels of error handling:
   - **Level 1**: Simple defaults that "do the best you can"
   - **Level 2**: Basic requirements (minimum thresholds)
   - **Level 3**: Full policy control (timeouts, budgets, custom handlers)

4. **Compositionality is Critical**: Error handling semantics must compose cleanly - if operation A can produce 5-10 results and operation B needs at least 7, the composition must handle this mismatch predictably.

## Agreed Principles

1. **Sensible Defaults**: Most users want the system to collect what it can and continue, only failing on catastrophic errors.

2. **Effect Tracking**: Operations should declare their effects (AI calls, network, etc.) to enable pre-execution analysis.

3. **Resource Awareness**: The runtime should handle rate limiting and resource constraints transparently when possible.

4. **Clear Semantics**: Users need to understand what failure means in their specific context.

## Practical Requirements

Users need to answer four key questions:
1. What's the minimum acceptable result?
2. How long am I willing to wait?
3. How much am I willing to spend?
4. What's my fallback plan?

## Open Research Questions

### 1. Formal Semantics of Partial Failure
- How do we formally model workflows that can partially succeed?
- What does workflow equivalence mean in the presence of non-determinism?
- How do we compose operations with different failure characteristics?

### 2. Type System Integration
- Should failure modes be reflected in types? How?
- Can we use dependent types to track cardinality constraints?
- How do effect types interact with error handling?

### 3. Runtime Architecture
- How to implement global resource management (rate limits across all operations)?
- When to eagerly vs lazily evaluate in the presence of possible failures?
- How to efficiently implement checkpointing and recovery?

### 4. User Experience
- How to present partial failures to users without overwhelming them?
- What debugging tools are needed for complex failure scenarios?
- How to help users write robust workflows without excessive boilerplate?

### 5. Optimization and Performance
- Can we statically analyze workflows to predict failure modes?
- How to optimize workflows while preserving error handling semantics?
- When can we safely batch operations that might individually fail?

### 6. Policy Composition
- How do error handling policies compose when workflows are nested?
- Can we infer reasonable policies from workflow structure?
- How to handle conflicting policies in composed workflows?

## Next Steps

1. **Define Formal Semantics**: Create a mathematical model for partial operations and their composition.

2. **Prototype Implementation**: Build a minimal runtime that demonstrates the progressive sophistication model.

3. **User Studies**: Test whether our error handling mental model matches how users think about failures.

4. **Type System Design**: Explore how much error information should be surfaced in types vs runtime.

5. **Policy Language**: Design a declarative way to express error handling policies that compose well.

## Example Scenarios to Test

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering 1000 responses where some fail - what constitutes success?
2. **Pipeline Processing**: Multi-stage pipeline where stage 3 fails after expensive stages 1-2.
3. **Parallel Exploration**: Running 20 parallel analyses where 5 fail - how to aggregate?
4. **Quality Thresholds**: Generating content until quality threshold met - how to express?
5. **Resource Limits**: Complex workflow approaching budget limit - how to gracefully degrade?

These scenarios will help validate our error handling design and ensure it meets real-world needs.
