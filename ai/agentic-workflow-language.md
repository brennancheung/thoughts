# Agentic Workflow Language

## The Problem

Current AI interfaces trap us in linear conversations. You ask a question, get an answer, ask another question. But real intellectual work doesn't happen linearly—you explore multiple paths, compare alternatives, combine insights, and build understanding through iteration.

Imagine trying to:
- Explore 10 variations of an idea and pick the best 3
- Get multiple perspectives on a topic and find the consensus
- Branch a conversation into parallel explorations then merge the insights
- Transform outputs through multiple stages of refinement

With chat interfaces, this requires endless copy-pasting, manual tracking, and mental juggling. The interface fights against how we actually think.

## The Solution: A Language for AI Orchestration

This language treats AI conversations as data that can be transformed through composable operations. Just like how programming languages let us manipulate data structures, this language lets us manipulate conversations and AI outputs.

Core insight: Every AI interaction produces data that can flow into other operations. By making these flows explicit and composable, we unlock entirely new ways of working with AI.

## One to Many, Many to One: The Core Pattern

At its heart, this language is about transforming between single items and collections—a pattern that appears everywhere in both programming and mathematics.

### The Universal Pattern

Think of it like this:
- **Expand** (or scatter, spread, generate): Take one thing and create many variations
- **Reduce** (or gather, collect, merge): Take many things and combine them into one

This same pattern appears in:
- **Programming**: `map/reduce`, `flatMap/fold`, list comprehensions
- **Mathematics**: Unfold/fold, generators/collectors, one-to-many/many-to-one functions
- **Real work**: Brainstorming/deciding, exploring/concluding, researching/synthesizing

### It's All the Same Thing

Whether you call it arrays, streams, or parallel conversations, the concept is identical:

```
// These are equivalent concepts:
"idea" → [idea₁, idea₂, idea₃, ...]  // Array of results
"idea" → stream<ideas>                // Stream of results  
"idea" → parallel conversations       // Multiple AI chats

// And these operations are the same:
expand 10        // Create 10 variations
map operation    // Apply to each item in parallel
filter criteria  // Keep only matching items
/ reduce         // Combine back into one
```

### Practical Examples

```
// Expand one topic into many subtopics, then pick the best
"startup idea" 
    | expand 10        // One → Many: Generate 10 variations
    | evaluate         // Many → Many: Score each one
    / pick-best        // Many → One: Select the winner

// Or more concisely:
"startup idea" expand 10 | evaluate / pick-best
```

The `/` operator is our universal reducer—it takes many things and collapses them into one, whether that's picking the best, finding consensus, or merging insights.

### Why This Matters

This pattern is powerful because it matches how we actually think:
1. **Diverge**: Explore multiple possibilities
2. **Transform**: Work with each possibility
3. **Converge**: Synthesize back to actionable insights

By making this pattern explicit and easy to express, complex workflows become natural to write and understand.

### For Programmers and Mathematicians

If you're coming from a programming background:
- `expand` = `flatMap` or list comprehension
- `/` = `reduce` or `fold`
- `|` = `map` or pipeline operator
- The whole system = functional reactive streams

If you're coming from mathematics:
- `expand` = anamorphism (unfold)
- `/` = catamorphism (fold)
- Full pipeline = hylomorphism
- Operations = morphisms between categories

But you don't need to know any of this—the operations are intuitive because they match how we naturally think about problems.

## Language Primitives

### Core Data Types

- **Chat**: A single conversation thread
- **ChatArray**: Multiple parallel conversations
- **Topic**: A semantic starting point
- **Result**: Output of any operation

### Expand Operations (One → Many)

- `expand N` - Generate N variations (general purpose)
- `variations N` - Generate N variations (alias)
- `perspectives N` - Get N different viewpoints  
- `sub-topics N` - Create N subtopics
- `examples N` - Generate N examples
- `brainstorm N` - Generate N ideas
- `alternatives N` - Create N alternatives

### Transform Operations (Array → Array)

- `map [operation]` - Apply operation to each element
- `filter [criteria]` - Keep only matching elements
- `rank [criteria]` - Order by criteria
- `select N` - Take first N elements

### Reduce Operations (Many → One)

- `/ pick-best` - Select highest quality
- `/ consensus` - Find common ground
- `/ merge` - Combine coherently
- `/ synthesize` - Create unified output

### Transform Operations (One → One)

- `deep-dive` - Elaborate extensively
- `summarize` - Condense to key points
- `critique` - Analyze critically
- `refine` - Polish and improve

## Syntax

### Basic Pipeline
```
input | operation1 | operation2 | operation3
```

### Expand and Reduce
```
input operation N / reduction
```

### Complex Example
```
"AI safety" 
    sub-topics 5 
    | perspectives 3
    | filter "contrarian"
    / consensus
    | critique
    | refine
```

This generates 5 subtopics, gets 3 perspectives on each, filters for contrarian views, finds consensus among them, critiques the result, and refines it.

## Dynamic Interaction

The language supports dynamic exploration where you can reference and manipulate specific conversations:

```
// Reference specific outputs
{{#3}} {{#7}} merge summarize

// Branch from existing conversation
{{#3}} branch {
    technical: deep-dive | examples 3
    practical: applications 5 | rank "feasibility"
} compare
```

## Real-World Workflows

### Research Analysis
```
paper-topic
    research-questions 10
    | literature-search
    | group "methodology"
    / identify-gaps
    | propose-studies 3
    | feasibility-check
    / rank "impact"
```

### Creative Development  
```
story-premise
    plot-variations 7
    | develop-characters
    | conflict-analysis
    / strongest-narrative
    | scene-breakdown 10
    | parallel-drafts 3
    / reader-test
```

### Problem Solving
```
problem-statement
    root-causes 5
    | solution-space 4
    | evaluate-tradeoffs
    / optimal-approach
    | implementation-plan
    | risk-assessment
    | mitigation-strategies
```

## Implementation Modes

### 1. Direct Syntax
Write operations directly using the language:
```
topic variations 10 | evaluate / pick-best 3
```

### 2. Natural Language
AI interprets intent and generates operations:
```
"Give me 10 ways to approach this problem and help me pick the best 3"
→ topic variations 10 | evaluate / pick-best 3
```

### 3. Interactive
Build workflows step-by-step with visible results at each stage.

## Why This Matters

1. **Cognitive Alignment**: Works how we think—exploring multiple paths, comparing options, building understanding iteratively

2. **Composability**: Small operations combine into powerful workflows

3. **Visibility**: See your entire thought process, not just the final result

4. **Reusability**: Save and replay successful workflow patterns

5. **Scale**: Handle complexity that would overwhelm linear chat

## Advanced Patterns

### Tree Search
```
hypothesis
    experiments 5
    | predict-outcomes
    | run-simulations
    / most-promising 2
    | variations 3
    | deep-analysis
    / optimal-path
```

### Ensemble Intelligence
```
question agents ["analyst", "creative", "critic"] 
    | deliberate
    / synthesize
```

### Iterative Refinement
```
draft iterate 5 [
    critique | address-issues | improve
]
```

## Getting Started

Start simple:
```
"your topic" variations 5 / pick-best
```

Then build complexity:
```
"your topic" 
    variations 5 
    | evaluate
    | rank "novelty"
    | select 3
    | deep-dive
    / synthesize
```

The language grows with your needs, from simple explorations to complex multi-agent orchestrations.

## Full Example: YouTube Creator Workflow

Let's walk through a complete real-world example of creating a YouTube video using the agentic workflow language.

### Defining Custom Operations

First, we define reusable operations with their prompts:

```
let trending-analysis niche =
    "Analyze current trends in {niche} on YouTube. Focus on:
    - Videos getting high engagement in the last 7 days
    - Emerging topics not yet saturated
    - Viewer pain points in comments
    Return a structured analysis with specific video opportunities."

let title-optimizer topic =
    "Create a compelling YouTube title for: {topic}
    Requirements:
    - Under 60 characters
    - Include emotional hook
    - Clear value proposition
    - SEO-friendly keywords
    Consider successful patterns in this niche."

let hook-generator topic =
    "Write a 15-second hook for a video about: {topic}
    Requirements:
    - Create curiosity gap
    - Promise clear value
    - Address viewer's problem
    - Set up the payoff"

let script-section section topic previous_sections =
    "Write the {section} section for a video about: {topic}
    Context: {previous_sections}
    Requirements:
    - Conversational tone
    - One key idea per paragraph
    - Include examples
    - Transition smoothly from previous section"
```
