# Context Engineering: Multi-Agent Deliberation Workflow

## Scenario Overview
A product team needs to make a critical decision about whether to pivot their AI assistant product to focus on enterprise customers or continue with the consumer market. Multiple AI agents with different perspectives will deliberate and reach a consensus.

## Context Flow Architecture

### Phase 1: Shared Context Initialization

**Base Context Bundle (Shared by All Agents):**
```yaml
decision_context:
  question: "Should we pivot to enterprise or stay consumer-focused?"
  company_state:
    current_revenue: "$2M ARR"
    growth_rate: "15% MoM"
    runway: "18 months"
    team_size: 12
  
  market_data:
    consumer_segment:
      tam: "$50B"
      competition: "High - 200+ players"
      cac: "$50"
      ltv: "$150"
      churn: "8% monthly"
    
    enterprise_segment:
      tam: "$30B"
      competition: "Medium - 20 players"
      cac: "$5000"
      ltv: "$50000"
      churn: "2% monthly"
  
  constraints:
    - "Limited engineering resources"
    - "No enterprise sales experience"
    - "Strong consumer brand recognition"
```

### Phase 2: Agent-Specific Context Injection

**Agent 1: Financial Analyst Context**
```yaml
agent_role: "Financial Analyst"
specialized_context:
  financial_models:
    - dcf_analysis
    - unit_economics
    - scenario_planning
  
  additional_data:
    - historical_pivots_success_rate: "35%"
    - enterprise_sales_cycle: "6-12 months"
    - implementation_cost: "$500K"
  
  evaluation_criteria:
    primary: "ROI and cash flow"
    secondary: "Risk-adjusted returns"
```

**Agent 2: Market Strategist Context**
```yaml
agent_role: "Market Strategist"
specialized_context:
  frameworks:
    - porters_five_forces
    - blue_ocean_strategy
    - crossing_the_chasm
  
  market_intelligence:
    - enterprise_adoption_trends
    - consumer_market_saturation
    - competitive_moats
  
  evaluation_criteria:
    primary: "Market positioning"

    enterprise_needs:
      - "SOC2 compliance"
      - "On-premise deployment"
      - "SSO/SAML integration"
      - "99.9% SLA"
    
    current_capabilities:
      - "Cloud-native architecture"
      - "Consumer-grade security"
      - "Social login only"
  
  evaluation_criteria:
    primary: "Technical feasibility"
    secondary: "Development timeline"
```

**Agent 4: Customer Success Lead Context**
```yaml
agent_role: "Customer Success Lead"
specialized_context:
  customer_insights:
    consumer_feedback:
      - nps_score: 72
      - top_requests: ["more features", "lower price"]
    
    enterprise_inquiries:
      - volume: "20/month"
      - requirements: ["security", "integration", "support"]
  
  support_metrics:
    - current_ticket_volume: "500/week"
    - enterprise_support_cost: "10x consumer"
  
  evaluation_criteria:
    primary: "Customer satisfaction potential"
    secondary: "Support scalability"
```

### Phase 3: Initial Position Generation

**Context Transformation per Agent:**
```yaml
position_generation_context:
  agent_id: "financial_analyst"
  inputs:
    - shared_context
    - specialized_context
    - role_perspective
  
  output_structure:
    position: "pivot" | "stay"
    confidence: 0.0-1.0
    key_arguments: [list]
    risks_identified: [list]
    mitigation_strategies: [list]
```

**Generated Positions:**
```yaml
initial_positions:
  financial_analyst:
    position: "pivot"
    confidence: 0.75
    reasoning: "Enterprise LTV/CAC ratio 10x better"
    concerns: ["High upfront investment", "Long sales cycle"]
  
  market_strategist:
    position: "stay"
    confidence: 0.65
    reasoning: "Established brand, growing market"
    concerns: ["Increasing competition", "Platform risk"]
  
  technical_architect:
    position: "pivot"
    confidence: 0.60
    reasoning: "Architecture can be adapted"
    concerns: ["6-month development timeline", "Team training"]
  
  customer_success:
    position: "stay"
    confidence: 0.70
    reasoning: "High customer satisfaction"
    concerns: ["Growing support costs", "Feature requests"]
```

### Phase 4: Deliberation Rounds

**Round 1: Position Exchange**
```yaml
deliberation_context_round_1:
  visible_to_all:
    - all_initial_positions
    - key_arguments_summary
  
  agent_prompts:
    instruction: "Review other positions and identify:"
    tasks:
      - "Points of agreement"
      - "Critical disagreements"
      - "Information gaps"
      - "Questions for other agents"
```

**Inter-Agent Context Queries:**
```yaml
context_requests:
  to_financial_analyst:
    from: "technical_architect"
    question: "What's the break-even timeline with dev costs?"
    
  to_market_strategist:
    from: "customer_success"
    question: "Can we maintain consumer base during pivot?"
    
  response_context:
    break_even: "14 months with enterprise pivot"
    dual_market: "Possible but dilutes focus"
```

**Round 2: Synthesis Attempt**
```yaml
synthesis_context:
  emerging_consensus:
    - "Enterprise has better unit economics"
    - "Technical transition is feasible"
    - "Market timing is critical"
  
  remaining_conflicts:
    - "Resource allocation priorities"
    - "Brand positioning strategy"
    - "Timeline aggressiveness"
  
  compromise_proposals:
    proposal_1:
      description: "Gradual pivot with pilot program"
      supporters: ["technical", "customer_success"]
      
    proposal_2:
      description: "Dual-track with separate teams"
      supporters: ["market_strategist"]
```

### Phase 5: Consensus Building

**Mediator Agent Context:**
```yaml
mediator_context:
  all_positions: [position_history]
  conflict_points: [identified_conflicts]
  shared_goals:
    - "Sustainable growth"
    - "Market leadership"
    - "Team retention"
  
  synthesis_framework:
    - weight_arguments_by_expertise
    - identify_false_dichotomies
    - find_creative_combinations
```

**Final Deliberation Context:**
```yaml
consensus_building:
  proposed_solution:
    decision: "Phased enterprise pivot"
    details:
      phase_1: "Launch enterprise pilot (3 months)"
      phase_2: "Validate product-market fit"
      phase_3: "Full pivot if metrics met"
    
  success_criteria:
    - "3 enterprise customers in pilot"
    - "NPS > 8 from enterprise users"
    - "Clear path to $10M ARR"
    
  risk_mitigation:
    - "Maintain consumer product during pilot"
    - "Hire enterprise sales advisor"
    - "Set clear go/no-go metrics"
```

### Phase 6: Final Context Merge

**Unified Decision Context:**
```yaml
final_decision:
  recommendation: "Phased enterprise pivot"
  confidence: 0.82
  
  supporting_evidence:
    financial: "10x better unit economics"
    market: "Less saturated, higher barriers"
    technical: "Achievable with current team"
    customer: "Strong enterprise interest"
  
  implementation_context:
    immediate_actions:
      - "Form enterprise tiger team"
      - "Begin compliance research"
      - "Identify pilot customers"
    
    monitoring_plan:
      - "Weekly metrics review"
      - "Monthly strategic assessment"
      - "Quarterly pivot decision"
```

## Context Engineering Patterns

### 1. Context Isolation Pattern
```yaml
agent_contexts:
  shared: [common_knowledge]
  private: [role_specific_data]
  revealed: [shared_during_deliberation]
```

### 2. Context Merging Pattern
```
Individual Contexts -> Deliberation Space -> Synthesized Context -> Final Decision
```

### 3. Progressive Context Revelation
```yaml
rounds:
  1: "Initial positions only"
  2: "Positions + reasoning"
  3: "Full context + questions"
  4: "Synthesis attempts"
  5: "Final consensus"
```

### 4. Context Conflict Resolution
```yaml
conflict_handling:
  identify: "Find contradictions"
  explore: "Understand root causes"
  synthesize: "Find higher-order solutions"
  validate: "Check against shared goals"
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Context Window Management
```yaml
context_prioritization:
  always_include:
    - Current proposal
    - Key metrics
    - Agent roles
  
  compress_as_needed:
    - Historical arguments
    - Detailed evidence
    - Previous rounds
  
  retrieve_on_demand:
    - Supporting data
    - External research
    - Detailed calculations
```

### Preventing Context Poisoning
- **Fact Checking**: Validate shared data claims
- **Source Attribution**: Track information origin
- **Consistency Checks**: Flag contradictions
- **Authority Limits**: Respect role boundaries

### Deadlock Prevention
```yaml
deadlock_handling:
  detection:
    - "Same arguments repeating"
    - "No position changes in 2 rounds"
    - "Fundamental value conflicts"
  
  resolution:
    - "Introduce new information"
    - "Reframe the question"
    - "Escalate to human decision"
    - "Time-box deliberation"
```

This workflow showcases complex multi-agent context coordination, demonstrating how separate contexts can be maintained, selectively shared, and ultimately merged to reach group decisions.
