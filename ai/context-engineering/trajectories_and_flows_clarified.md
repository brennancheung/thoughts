# Trajectories and Flows in LLMs: A Precise Technical Clarification

## Your Understanding (Which is Correct!)

You're absolutely right:
1. Tokens are integers (indices into vocabulary)
2. Each token becomes a high-dimensional point (via embedding lookup)
3. The prompt becomes an array of these points
4. These points get transformed through layers
5. They remain an array of points throughout

So what do I mean by "trajectory"?

## The Missing Dimension: Depth Through Layers

### What a Trajectory Really Is

A **trajectory** is the path a single token's representation takes as it moves through the layers of the network:

```python
# For a single token at position i:
token_id = 1639  # "Hello"

# Its trajectory through the network:
point_layer_0 = embedding[token_id]          # [768,] vector
point_layer_1 = transformer_layer_1(...)[i]  # [768,] vector  
point_layer_2 = transformer_layer_2(...)[i]  # [768,] vector
...
point_layer_12 = transformer_layer_12(...)[i] # [768,] vector

# The TRAJECTORY is the sequence:
# [point_layer_0, point_layer_1, ..., point_layer_12]
```

### Visualizing the Trajectory

```
Layer 0: •———————————————————→ (initial embedding)
         ↓
Layer 1: •———————————————————→ (transformed by attention + FFN)
         ↓
Layer 2: •———————————————————→ (further transformed)
         ↓
...      ↓
Layer N: •———————————————————→ (final representation)

Each • is a point in 768D space
The path connecting them is the TRAJECTORY
```

## The Full Picture: Multiple Simultaneous Trajectories

For a prompt with N tokens, you have N trajectories happening in parallel:

```python
prompt = "Hello world"  # 2 tokens
# Token trajectories:
# "Hello": [h0_0, h1_0, h2_0, ..., h12_0]
# "world": [h0_1, h1_1, h2_1, ..., h12_1]

# At each layer, you have an array of points:
layer_0_points = [embedding["Hello"], embedding["world"]]  # Shape: [2, 768]
layer_1_points = transformer_1(layer_0_points)             # Shape: [2, 768]
# etc.
```

## Why "Trajectory" and "Flow" Are Meaningful Terms

### 1. The Representation Evolves

The key insight is that the representation of "Hello" at layer 0 is fundamentally different from its representation at layer 12:

```python
# Early layers: more syntactic, position-focused
hello_layer_1 = [0.1, -0.3, 0.5, ...]  # Encodes: "first word, capitalized"

# Middle layers: semantic emergence  
hello_layer_6 = [0.2, 0.8, -0.1, ...]  # Encodes: "greeting, informal"

# Late layers: task-specific
hello_layer_12 = [0.9, -0.2, 0.3, ...] # Encodes: "beginning of friendly interaction"
```

### 2. The Path Matters

The trajectory isn't random - it follows learned pathways:

```python
# Different contexts create different trajectories for the same token
"Hello world"  → hello follows one trajectory
"Hello doctor" → hello follows a different trajectory (due to attention)
```

### 3. It's Continuous Transformation

Each layer applies continuous transformations:

```python
def layer_transformation(x):
    # Attention: mix information from other positions
    x = x + attention(x)
    # FFN: non-linear transformation
    x = x + feed_forward(x)
    return x

# This creates smooth paths through space, not discrete jumps
```

## What I Mean By "Flow"

**Flow** refers to the collective movement of all token representations through the network:

```python
# The flow is the entire system evolution:
flow = {
    'token_0': [h0_0 → h1_0 → ... → h12_0],
    'token_1': [h0_1 → h1_1 → ... → h12_1],
    ...
    'token_n': [h0_n → h1_n → ... → h12_n]
}

# These trajectories influence each other through attention
```

## A Concrete Example

Let's trace "cat" in different contexts:

```python
# Context 1: "The cat sat"
cat_trajectory_1 = {
    'layer_0': embed("cat"),                    # Basic animal embedding
    'layer_3': cat_with_determiner_context,     # "The" influences representation
    'layer_6': cat_as_subject,                  # Syntactic role emerges
    'layer_12': cat_ready_for_verb_prediction   # Prepared for "sat"
}

# Context 2: "pet the cat"  
cat_trajectory_2 = {
    'layer_0': embed("cat"),                    # Same starting point!
    'layer_3': cat_with_verb_context,           # "pet" influences differently
    'layer_6': cat_as_object,                   # Different syntactic role
    'layer_12': cat_as_recipient_of_action      # Different final representation
}
```

## Why This Matters for Context Engineering

When you provide a prompt, you're:

1. **Setting initial positions** (the embedding points)
2. **Influencing the trajectories** these points will take
3. **Shaping the flow** of information through attention
4. **Biasing final destinations** in representation space

## The Mathematical View

If we want to be fully precise:

```
Let h_i^(l) be the representation of token i at layer l

Trajectory of token i: T_i = [h_i^(0), h_i^(1), ..., h_i^(L)]

The transformer defines a function F such that:
h_i^(l+1) = F(h_0^(l), h_1^(l), ..., h_n^(l), i)
           
Note: Each token's next position depends on ALL tokens' current positions
```

## So Yes, You're Right, But...

Your understanding is correct:
- Yes, it's always an array of high-dimensional points
- Yes, these points get transformed through layers
- Yes, they remain discrete points

But "trajectory" adds the crucial **temporal/depth dimension**:
- Each point has a path through the layers
- These paths are continuous and smooth
- The paths depend on context (attention to other tokens)
- The journey matters as much as the destination

## Analogy

Think of it like tracking multiple particles through a fluid:
- Each particle (token) has a position at each moment (layer)
- The particles influence each other's paths (attention)
- The fluid flow (learned transformations) guides their movement
- We care about both where they end up AND how they got there

That's what I mean by trajectories and flows in the context of transformers!
