# Context Engineering: Mathematical Foundations Document

## Purpose
This document serves as an intermediary representation of context engineering concepts, structured to facilitate analysis through various mathematical frameworks including type theory, category theory, information theory, and others. It consolidates empirical observations and practical patterns into formal structures amenable to mathematical treatment.

## 1. Fundamental Objects and Entities

### 1.1 Context (C)
A context is a structured collection of information that enables computation and decision-making.

**Properties:**
- **Bounded**: Every context has finite capacity (context window)
- **Temporal**: Contexts exist at specific points in time
- **Compositional**: Contexts can be combined, split, or transformed
- **Typed**: Contexts have structure and constraints

**Formal Structure:**
```
Context := {
  content: Information,
  metadata: Properties,
  constraints: Rules,
  timestamp: Time
}
```

### 1.2 Information Elements (I)
The atomic units that compose contexts.

**Types:**
- System prompts/instructions
- User inputs
- Memory (short-term and long-term)
- Retrieved knowledge
- Tool outputs
- Agent states

**Properties:**
- Relevance score
- Information density
- Temporal validity
- Source attribution

### 1.3 Agents (A)
Computational entities that process contexts and produce outputs.

**Properties:**
- Role/specialization
- Context requirements
- Processing capabilities
- Output constraints

**Formal Structure:**
```
Agent := {
  role: Role,
  process: Context → Context,
  constraints: Set<Constraint>
}
```

### 1.4 Tools (T)
External capabilities that agents can invoke.

**Properties:**
- Input schema
- Output schema
- Side effects
- Context transformation function

## 2. Core Operations and Transformations

### 2.1 Context Operations

#### Retrieval (ρ)
```
ρ: Query × KnowledgeBase → Set<Information>
```
Fetches relevant information from external sources.

#### Filtering (φ)
```
φ: Context × Criteria → Context
```
Removes irrelevant or redundant information.

#### Compression (κ)
```
κ: Context → Context
where size(κ(C)) < size(C)
```
Reduces context size while preserving essential information.

#### Augmentation (α)
```
α: Context × Information → Context
```
Adds new information to existing context.

#### Merging (μ)
```
μ: Context × Context → Context
```
Combines multiple contexts into a unified context.

#### Isolation (ι)
```
ι: Context → Set<Context>
```
Splits context into independent sub-contexts.

### 2.2 Compositional Patterns

#### Sequential Composition
```
f ∘ g: Context → Context
where (f ∘ g)(C) = f(g(C))
```

#### Parallel Composition
```
f ⊗ g: Context → (Context, Context)
where (f ⊗ g)(C) = (f(C), g(C))
```

#### Conditional Composition
```
f ⊕ g: Context × Predicate → Context
where (f ⊕ g)(C, p) = if p(C) then f(C) else g(C)
```

## 3. Workflows as Compositional Structures

### 3.1 Basic Workflow Patterns

#### Linear Flow
```
W_linear = f₁ ∘ f₂ ∘ ... ∘ fₙ
```

#### Branching Flow
```
W_branch = f₁ ∘ (f₂ ⊕ f₃) ∘ f₄
```

#### Parallel Processing
```
W_parallel = f₁ ∘ (f₂ ⊗ f₃) ∘ μ
```

#### Iterative Refinement
```
W_iterate = f₁ ∘ (f₂ ∘ f₃)ⁿ ∘ f₄
```

### 3.2 Complex Workflow Examples

#### RAG Workflow
```
W_RAG = ρ ∘ φ ∘ κ ∘ α ∘ generate
```

```
W_deliberate = ι ∘ (agent₁ ⊗ agent₂ ⊗ ... ⊗ agentₙ) ∘ μ ∘ consensus
```

  long_term: KnowledgeBase
}
```

### 4.2 State Transitions
```
σ: State × Context → State
```
Updates system state based on context.

### 4.3 Memory Operations
- Store: `Context → Memory`

```
relevance: Context × Goal → [0, 1]
```

### 6.2 Information Density
```
density(C) = useful_information(C) / size(C)
```

```
efficiency(W, C) = quality(W(C)) / computational_cost(W, C)
```

## 7. Failure Modes as Mathematical Properties

### 7.1 Context Overflow
```
overflow(C) ⟺ size(C) > window_limit
```

### 7.2 Information Loss

```

## 8. Algebraic Properties
