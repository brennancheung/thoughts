# Context Engineering: Overview and Document Guide

## Introduction

## Key Themes and Patterns

### Core Context Operations
1. **Retrieve** (ρ): Fetch relevant information from knowledge sources
2. **Filter** (φ): Remove irrelevant or redundant information
3. **Compress** (κ): Reduce context size while preserving essentials
4. **Augment** (α): Add new information to existing context
5. **Merge** (μ): Combine multiple contexts
6. **Isolate** (ι): Split context into independent sub-contexts

### Compositional Patterns
- **Sequential**: `f ∘ g` - Chain operations
- **Parallel**: `f ⊗ g` - Process simultaneously
- **Conditional**: `f ⊕ g` - Choose based on predicate
- **Iterative**: `(f ∘ g)ⁿ` - Repeat until condition met

### Architectural Principles
1. Context as a dynamic runtime, not static prompt
2. Separation of concerns through context isolation
3. Progressive context refinement
4. Memory hierarchy management
5. Explicit control over context flow
6. **Hierarchical context with lexical scoping**
7. **Context as execution environments with closures**
8. **Phenomenological awareness - the "felt sense" of context**
9. **Proto-scientific approach - embracing productive mystery**

## Mathematical Framework Readiness

The documents are structured to support analysis through:

### Category Theory
- Objects: Contexts, Agents, Workflows
- Morphisms: Transformations between contexts
- Functors: Structure-preserving mappings
- Natural transformations: Between representations

### Type Theory
- Context types with constraints
- Dependent types for role-specific contexts
- Linear types for single-use contexts
- Type safety for context operations

### Information Theory
- Context entropy measurements
- Mutual information between contexts
- Information gain from operations
- Optimal information density

### Formal Methods
- Safety properties (no overflow, no corruption)
- Liveness properties (progress, termination)
- Invariant preservation
- Verification of workflows
